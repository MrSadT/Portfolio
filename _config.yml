          I started with C# and Unity, but realized it wasn't for me and switched to Unreal Engine.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          After discovering my passion for game development, I began teaching myself programming and game design through online courses, documentation, and community projects.
          
          This self-driven approach taught me discipline, problem solving, and how to learn new technologies quickly.

  - title: A Little More About Me
    layout: text
    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      Outside of coding and experimenting with new gameplay ideas, Iâ€™m also interested in:
      - Server-side development and backend logic for multiplayer systems
      - Unix-based environments and shell scripting
      - Networking protocols, optimization, and server management
      - Performance profiling and debugging tools
      - Automation and CI/CD pipelines for game builds

      "I love turning ideas into something you can play."
